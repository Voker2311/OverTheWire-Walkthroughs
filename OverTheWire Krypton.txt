OverTheWire Krypton

Level 0 to Level 1:

Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64:

S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=
Use this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with username krypton1 using SSH on port 2231. You can find the files for other levels in /krypton/

root@LAPTOP-U5913CMD:/home/akshay# echo 'S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=' | base64 -d
KRYPTONISGREATroot@LAPTOP-U5913CMD:/home/akshay#


Decoded String -> KRYPTONISGREAT

This is the password for Level 1 :

Level 1 to Level 2:

The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

This is a rot13 cipher and the decoded string looks like this:
-> LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN

Password is ROTTEN

Level 2 to Level3:

Additional Information:

The encrypt binary will look for the keyfile in your current working directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the encrypt binary runs setuid krypton3, you also need to give krypton3 access to your working directory.

krypton2@krypton:/$ cd /tmp
krypton2@krypton:/tmp$ mkdir akki
krypton2@krypton:/tmp$ cd akki
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ ls
keyfile.dat
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt /tmp/akki/keyfile.dat
failed to create cipher file
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ chmod 777 .
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt /tmp/akki/keyfile.dat
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ ls
ciphertext  keyfile.dat
krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$ cat ciphertext
YZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX

krypton2@krypton:/tmp/akki$

So the key is 12 and the decoded string looks like this:CAESARISEASY

The password for level3 -> CAESARISEASY

Level 3 to Level4:

Well done. You’ve moved past an easy substitution cipher.

The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is repeated use of a simple key. In the previous exercise you were able to introduce arbitrary plaintext to expose the key. In this example, the cipher mechanism is not available to you, the attacker.

However, you have been lucky. You have intercepted more than one message. The password to the next level is found in the file ‘krypton4’. You have also found 3 other files. (found1, found2, found3)

You know the following important details:

The message plaintexts are in English (*** very important) - They were produced from the same key (*** even better!)
Enjoy.

Its all about frequency analysis of english language where 'e' is used a lot of times.

I got stuck with this challenge so I looked at this walkthrough for this level.

https://medium.com/@KamranSaifullah/overthewire-krypton-cryptography-challenges-9001e839cd23

He explained it very well in this walkthrough.

Also this guy explained it with python program
https://axcheron.github.io/writeups/otw/krypton/

After analyzing the files I found the password to be:

WELLDONETHELEVELFOURPASSWORDISBRUTE

Password for level 4 is BRUTE

Level 4 to Level 5:

Vignere cipher is a very good technique and it is also easy to crack.

If we use the key(K) ‘GOLD’, and P = PROCEED MEETING AS AGREED, then “add” P to K, we get C. When adding, if we exceed 25, then we roll to 0 (modulo 26).

P P R O C E E D M E E T I N G A S A G R E E D\
K G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O\
becomes:

P 15 17 14 2 4 4 3 12 4 4 19 8 13 6 0 18 0 6 17 4 4 3\
K 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14\
C 21 5 25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18 4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20 2 8 10 17\
So, we get a ciphertext of:

VFZFK SOPKS ELTUL VGUCH KR

So we got a text that contains the key that was used to encrpyt and also the key length is of 6 digits.

There's this website that can help you find the key with the following info.

https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver

The key that was used is "frekey".

We can use the exact same key to find the original plaintext.

You guys can refer this website-> https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher

Vigenere  FREKEY
(Alphabet (26) ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)
-> CLEAR TEXT
Password for Level 5 -> CLEARTEXT

krypton5@krypton:/krypton/krypton4$ id
uid=8005(krypton5) gid=8005(krypton5) groups=8005(krypton5)
krypton5@krypton:/krypton/krypton4$


Level 5 to LeveL 6:

Level Info
FA can break a known key length as well. Lets try one last polyalphabetic cipher, but this time the key length is unknown.

Enjoy.

So I used the same website and the website was able to guess the key using trial and error combo.

Clear text using key "keylength":
So the key = "keylength"

Same was found for the text file found2.

So I decoded krpyton6 password using the key "keylength"

BELOS Z -> RANDO M

So the password for Level6 is RANDOM

krypton6@krypton:~$ id
uid=8006(krypton6) gid=8006(krypton6) groups=8006(krypton6)
krypton6@krypton:~$

Level 6 to Level7:

I found this nice explanation about this level at this website:

https://l3ouu4n9.github.io/blog/2018/08/27/Overthewire-Krypton/

Its uses LFSR to decode the following.


krypton6@krypton:/tmp/gg$ python -c "print 'A' * 200"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
krypton6@krypton:/tmp/gg$ python -c "print 'A' * 200" > plaintext
krypton6@krypton:/tmp/gg$ /krypton/krypton6/encrypt6 plaintext gg
krypton6@krypton:/tmp/gg$ cat gg
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN
EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXY


The key is repeating after certain intervals.
Now we can use this key to decode the following krypton7 password.
-> PNUKLYLWRQKGKBE

We can use the key and Cipher to decode

Decoded string - > LFSRISNOTRANDOM

krypton7@krypton:~$ id
uid=8007(krypton7) gid=8007(krypton7) groups=8007(krypton7)
krypton7@krypton:~$


It was a very good machine to practice cryptography skills.

Thank you for checking it out.
